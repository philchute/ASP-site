# Customizable Card Games (CCGs)

This page provides an overview of active Customizable Card Games (CCGs) in North America as of December 2025 and some links to resources.
This is as much to organize my own thoughts as it is to provide as service to others, but I hope you are able to find this useful. 
In some ways this is a better organized version of the [wikipedia list of CCGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_collectible_card_games).
Most of the upcoming release dates are gathered from this [article](https://www.vintageccg.com/ccg-news/tcg-release-schedule-2024/).
A lot of vintage rulebooks are available as PDFs [here](https://www.vintageccg.com/download-rulebooks/).

## Tier 1: The Big Three

*The Big Three have been massively popular in the East and West for decades. Other games draw influence from these pioneering titles.*  

---

### Magic: The Gathering

Magic: The Gathering was designed by Richard Garfield and published by [Wizards of the Coast](https://company.wizards.com/) in 1993.

MtG estabished the baseline for CCG mechanics.  Resources were designated land cards as part of the deck, played once per turn and then tapped for mana energy. Creatures attack all at once in a designated attack phase and the defender could choose how to block with their creatures. Although incredibly innovative at the time, and a solid foundation for 10's of thousands of cards over the decades, there are funadmental flaws in the design that all later CCGs attempted to address. The land cards lead to mana flooding or mana screw, where variance in drawing cards leads to unwinnable games. Games begin with small creatures being played and build into powerful late game creatures. This can lead to a lot of dead cards late game, where the game can be decided based on the next card draw, rather than any playing skill. Despite the flaws, Magic is a beautiful and deep game with nearly infinite depth and challenge.

I love Magic, I think it's maybe the best and most complex game ever created by mankind, but my patience with Wizards of the Coast ran out years ago. I could not stand to support a company that treated their customers so poorly, so I stopped playing Magic. Now Magic is milking other IPs for ridiculous crossover sets, which I see as the death throes of the game already ruined by greed. Nevertheless, it remains popular, and currently features a $1,000,000 Pro Tour, a massive regional tournament scene, and regular Friday Night Magic events at thousands of local game stores.

### Pokemon Trading Card Game

The Pokemon TCG was first released in 1996 by Wizards of the Coast and is now published by The Pokémon Company. 
Pokemon is still going strong and at times rivals MtG in popularity.  
The resource system is rather primative, like MtG, but modern competitive decks feature a lot of fetch abilities which then requires only playing a few basic energy cards rather than dedicating a large percentage of the deck to energy.  
The combat mechanics are also relatively simple; the depth of play comes from understanding the different engines driving different decks, and how they interact, in order to shut down your opponent's deck.

Current formats:  
* Standard - cards from the previous year's sets
* Expanded - cards from the previous 10 years of sets
* Legacy - all cards from HeartGold & SoulSilver (2009) and later
* Unlimited - all cards
* Pauper - (casual format) - all common cards
* U150 - (casual format) - like Commander, 100 card singleton decks with no pokemon > 150HP

### Yu-Gi-Oh

Yu-Gi-Oh! is another legacy CCG that is still around after many years. Created in 1999 by Konami, it was originally quite similar to MtG but has evolved in its own way. Card draw is a major resource in Yu-Gi-Oh, so you are often strongest on your first turn, when you have the most cards, rather than in MtG where you build up to more powerful plays. It has a reputation for more complicated mechanics than other CCGs, with complicated cards and decks; nearly every deck in Yu-Gi-Oh plays like a combo deck in other games. Somewhat uniquely, the game does not have card rotation, so power creep has made modern decks absurdly powerful. Konami recently made the 'Time Wizard' format official, where the legal cards are based on a previous time, for example '[goat](https://formatlibrary.com/formats/goat)' format from 2005 or '[edison](https://formatlibrary.com/formats/edison)' format from 2010.

Packs are 8 commons and 1 rare card. Rares are 1/6 Ultra Rare, 1/12 Secret Rare, otherwise Super Rare. 24 packs per box.

## Tier 2: The Big Contenders

*Tier 2 consists of the other popular CCGs which have large competitive scenes and can be found in most game stores.*  

---

### Disney Lorcana

Disney Lorcana is a relatively new entry into the scene, designed by Ryan Miller and released in 2023. Lorcana is the first CCG from [Ravensburger](https://www.ravensburger.com/en-us/) representing one of the largest IP's in the world, Walt Disney.  
Lorcana features an innovative 'ink-well' system, where some (but not all) cards can be played face down to be used as energy. This eliminates problems with mana flooding but still allows for some depth in card design and deck crafting.  
The objective in Lorcana is collect 20 lore, which is often done with creatures. This means that combat is not a path to victory, but a way to control the board state and stall your opponent. Overall this is a well-crafted and easy-to-play CCG which has brought in many new players to the scene making it a top tier CCG within a short time. Ravensburger recently announced set rotation, with the first block of sets rotating out with the arrival of the third block in September.

Current formats:  
* Standard - Cards from the current and previous block
* Infinite - All cards with a banned list

### League of Legends: Riftbound

League of Legends: Riftbound was released in China earlier in 2025 and on October 31, 2025 in the US. The game hit with an immediate commetitive scene developing, leading to a run on available product and a bubble in single card prices. The next release is scheduled for February 2026 as the US releases catch up to the Chinese releases. Hopefully this game can live through the intial growing pains but it seems Riot Games is in for the long haul.

The game features many innovative mechanics. Players choose a legend which grants an ability and determines the deck colors and available champion cards and signature spells. Players start with one champion available for play and each player selects a battlefield. Players play their creatures to their base and must move them to one of the two battlefields to score points. 

These new gameplay mechanics and distinct feeling for many different decks has made the game very popular and that has been it's biggest flaw so far.

### One Piece Card Game

Based on the anime 'One Piece'. Since it was published in 2022 by [Bandai](https://www.bandai.com/en-us/), this card game has been extremely popular, balancing casual and competitive play.

### Digimon

[Digimon](https://digimoncard.com/) The first Digimon card game was released in 1997 but the current version was released in 2021 by [Bandai](https://www.bandai.com/en-us/) using their modern CCG combat mechanics. The resource system of the new Digimon is particularly innovative, with a memory track which moves back and forth as you play your cards. The turn flips when the memory track crosses 0 in the middle. You could play a card with a high cost on your first turn, but then it would be your opponent's turn and they would have that many energy to play with before having to pass the turn back to you.

### Gundam Card Game

Gundam Card Game is a brand new CCG based on the Gundam Franchise and published by [Bandai](https://www.bandai.com/en-us/). Combat mechanics are a refinement of other Bandai CCGs, where attacks occur one at a time at any point during the turn, targetting a specific tapped creature or the player's shields, where there is a chance the shield card could be drawn or have another effect with a 'Burst' mechanic. There is also an innovative 'Pilot' system which allows Pilot cards to be played as upgrades to Gundam creature cards, giving them additional stats and abilities. The resource system is a relatively simple seperate deck of energy cards drawn once per turn, although the predictability does allow for some fine tuned balance. The second player starts with an additional 'EX' energy card which can only be used once.

### Keyforge

[Keyforge](http://www.keyforging.com/) was designed by Richard Garfield and published by [Fantasy Flight Games](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/) since 2018. It is technically not a CCG because you buy the entire deck and cannot swap cards with another deck, as an attempt to solve problem of chasing individual cards on the secondary market in other CCGs. Keyforge is sold at big box retailers and seems to sell well but doesn't often see play at game stores.

## Union Arena

[Union Arena](https://www.unionarena-tcg.com/) is ananime themed CCG from [Bandai](https://www.bandai.com/en-us/) which has been popular in Japan. The Japanese releases have been ahead of the US releases so there have been a rapid pace of releases in the US to catch up. Union Arena is unique in that decks are built from a particular franchise, so new sets can be bought or ignored depending on your interest in the franchise.

The game features a two line mechanic where players play cards to their energy line, and move them forward to the battle line to do combat. Player skill involves moving cards between the lines in the optimal way.

## Boxed and Living Card Games
*Many card games are sold as boxed games, ranging from a deck of cards, shedding games like Uno or trick taking games like The Crew or the Lord of the Rings Trick Taking Game. Some boxed games are relevent here because their mechanics resemble CCGs. Some are sold as a complete game, while most offer expansions. Fantasy Flight Games invented and trademarked the 'Living Card Game' name, but the concept is also known as 'Expandable Card Games' or 'Non-collectible Customizable Card Games'. The idea is that a game similar to a CCG can be sold with all the cards needed to play in each expansion, rather than randomly distributed booster packs. These tend to be more social than competitive, as the meta-game is smaller and more fixed. Most LCGs have stopped printing, particularly the Fantasy Flight ones, with only a few still in print.*

### Android: Netrunner

[Android: Netrunner](https://www.androidnetrunner.com/) is a boxed CCG designed by Richard Garfield and published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2012. It originally had randomized cards, then shifted to a Living Card Game while at Fantasy Flight. Now it is published by [Null Signal Games](https://nullsignal.games/) as a living card game.
