## Gunpla Grades Overview

Gundam Plastic Model Kits (Gunpla) come in various scales and levels of detail, known as **Grades**. The standard scale is 1/144, but there are also 1/100, 1/60, and 1/48 scale kits. Here is a guide to the different grades, and numbered lines of kits within each grade. Even within a grade, there have been advances in the quality of the kits over the years, so newer kits typically offer the best modelling experience. If you are new to Gunpla, I would recommend starting with any HG kit from the past few years that looks good to you, and then branching out from there. Older kits and higher grades are where you really explore the hobby. 

### HG (High Grade) - 1/144

*   **Scale**: 1/144 (approx 13cm / 5 inches tall)
*   **Complexity**: Beginner to Intermediate
*   **Detail**: Good
*   **Notes**: High Grade was introduced in 1990 and at the time was the highest and most detailed grade, introducing the snap-together construction and different colored parts which are now standard for all grades. Now it is one of the simplest grades, with a huge range of models.
* **HGUC**: High Grade Universal Century - The widest line of HG kits. Originally featured only Mobile Suits from the Universal Century timeline, but starting in 2014 this line was expanded to include all timelines (with those kits sometimes labeled as **HGAC**, **HGAW**, **HGCC**, **HGCE**, and **HGFC**), though lately each new series has again been getting its own numbered line of HG kits. The packaging for HGUC includes a colored square before the model number to indicate the series the kit is from:

Some lines of HG kits are at 1/100 scale, which display well with Master Grade kits. Some of these lines are marked as '1/100 HG' and some are just marked as '1/100 scale' or '1/100 Full Mechanics'. Some of these are considered NG - No Grade, but for simplicity are all listed here as HG.

Similarly there are lines of HG style kits at 1/60 scale (**1/60 Series**, **HGEX**) and 1/48 scale (**MSM/48** Mega Sized Model).


### MG (Master Grade) - 1/100
*   **Scale**: 1/100 (approx 18cm / 7 inches tall)
*   **Complexity**: Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detail**: High
*   **Notes**: Introduced in 1995 this grade features larger models with more detail and greater articulation. This has become one of the most popular grades for building and collecting. Beginning in 2020 there is a sub-line of redesigned MG kits called **MGEX** Master Grade Extreme.


### PG (Perfect Grade) - 1/60
*   **Scale**: 1/60 (approx 30cm / 12 inches tall)
*   **Complexity**: Expert
*   **Detail**: Ultimate
*   **Notes**: Introduced in 1998, Perfect Grades are even larger than MG models and feature even more detail. Featuring LED lighting, metal parts, and fully articulated fingers. Very expensive and time-consuming. There is also a PG kit from the series 'Evangelion' and a PG kit of the 'Millenium Falcon'. Beginning in 2020 there is a sub-line of even more detailed kits called **PGU** - Perfect Grade Unleashed.


### RG (Real Grade) - 1/144
*   **Scale**: 1/144
*   **Complexity**: Advanced
*   **Detail**: Extreme
*   **Notes**: Introduced in 2010, Real Grade kits are a realistic styling that combines the compact size of 1/144 HG scale with the detail and internal frame of MG. Known for their "Advanced MS Joint" pre-assembled internal frame system and high color separation. There are also six RG kits from the series 'Evangelion' and one from the series 'The King of Braves GaoGaiGar'.


### EG (Entry Grade) - 1/144
*   **Scale**: 1/144
*   **Complexity**: Beginner
*   **Detail**: Good
*   **Notes**: These are inexpensive and simpler kits in the same 1/144 scale as HG. Unfortunately by the time they are imported from Japan there isn't much price difference, so they don't have much purpose in the Western market. They feature snap-off parts which don't require clippers, and EG models still offer good articulation.


### SD (Super Deformed)
*   **Scale**: Non-scale (Chibi style)
*   **Complexity**: Beginner
*   **Detail**: Low
*   **Notes**: Cute, big-headed proportions. I like making the SD model as a palette cleanser after completing a Mobile Suit at a larger grade.
*   **SDBB**: Super Deformed BB Senshi - The original SD line, released between 1987-2018 with 412 kits in the line! The first kits in the line actually shot BB pellets which gave them their name.
*   **SDBBW**: Super Deformed Brave Battle Warriors - Released between 2010-2011 this line features characters from the series 'BB Senshi Sangokuden: Brave Battle Warriors'.
*   **SDEX**: Super Deformed EX Standard - Released starting in 2015 this line of SD kits features crossover parts with the 1/144 scale kits.
*   **SDCS**: Super Deformed Cross Silhouette - Released starting in 2018 this line features an internal frame and customizable proportions.


### MGSD (Master Grade Super Deformed)
*   **Scale**: Non-scale (Chibi style)
*   **Complexity**: Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detail**: High
*   **Notes**: Introduced in 2023, these bring Master Grade detail to the Super Deformed chibi style. Very nice models because they are brand new, and fairly complex to build.
