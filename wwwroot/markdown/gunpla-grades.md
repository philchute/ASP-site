## Gunpla Grades Overview

Gunpla (Gundam Plastic Models) come in various scales and levels of complexity known as **Grades**. Here is a quick guide to help you choose your next kit.

### HG (High Grade) - 1/144

*   **Scale**: 1/144 (approx 13cm / 5 inches tall)
*   **Complexity**: Beginner to Intermediate
*   **Detail**: Good
*   **Notes**: High Grade was introduced in 1990 and at the time was the highest and most detailed grade, featuring snap-together construction and different colored parts. Now these features are standard for all grades and HG is near the bottom of the available grades, but it is by far the most extensive line, offering a huge range of models. Newer HG kits are significantly better than older kits. Originallly alternative timeline models were included in the HGUC line, but recent series have spawned their own numbered lines of HG kits:
* **HG**: High Grade - Line started in 1990, no longer in production.
* **HGUC**: High Grade Universal Century - Line started in 1990, which continues to this day.
* **HG00**: High Grade Gundam 00 - Started in 2007, Mobile Suits from the Anno Domini timeline.
* **HGA**: High Grade Gundam AGE - Started in 2011, Mobile Suits from the Advanced Generation timeline.
* **HGR**: High Grade Reconguista In G - Released between 2014-2015, Mobile Suits from the Regild Century timeline.
* **HGIBO**: High Grade Iron Blooded Orphans - Started in 2015, Mobile Suits from the Post Disaster timeline. Allows the swapping of weapons and armor between kits and the Iron Blooded Arms sub-line.
* **HGWFM**: High Grade Witch From Mercury - Started in 2022, Mobile Suits from the Ad Stella timeline. Features a more modern design and a lot of articulation.

### MG (Master Grade) - 1/100
*   **Scale**: 1/100 (approx 18cm / 7 inches tall)
*   **Complexity**: Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detail**: High
*   **Notes**: Introduced in 1995 this grade features larger models with more detail and greater articulation. This has become one of the most popular grades for building and collecting. Beginning in 2020 there is a sub-line of redesigned MG kits called MGEX.

### RG (Real Grade) - 1/144
*   **Scale**: 1/144
*   **Complexity**: Advanced
*   **Detail**: Extreme
*   **Notes**: Introduced in 2010, Real Grade combines the compact size of HG with the detail and internal frame of MG. Known for their "Advanced MS Joint" system and high color separation. There are also six RG kits from the series Evangelion and one from the series The King of Braves GaoGaiGar.

### PG (Perfect Grade) - 1/60
*   **Scale**: 1/60 (approx 30cm / 12 inches tall)
*   **Complexity**: Expert
*   **Detail**: Ultimate
*   **Notes**: Introduced in 1998, Perfect Grades are an even larger than MG models and feature even more detail. Features LED lighting, metal parts, and fully articulated fingers. Very expensive and time-consuming. There is also a PG Evangellion model and a PG Millenium Falcon. Beginning in 2020 there is a sub-line of even more detailed kits called PGU - Perfect Grade Unleashed.

### EG (Entry Grade) - 1/144
*   **Scale**: 1/144
*   **Complexity**: Beginner
*   **Detail**: Good
*   **Notes**: These are inexpensive and simpler kits in the same scale as HG. Unfortunately by the time they are imported there isn't much price difference, so they don't have much purpose in the Western market. They have snap-off parts which don't require clippers, and still offer good articulation.

### SD (Super Deformed)
*   **Scale**: Non-scale (Chibi style)
*   **Complexity**: Beginner
*   **Detail**: Low
*   **Notes**: Cute, big-headed proportions. I like making the SD model of a more complex grade I just built as a quick palette cleanser.

### MG-SD (Master Grade Super Deformed)
*   **Scale**: Non-scale (Chibi style)
*   **Complexity**: Intermediate - Advanced
*   **Detail**: High
*   **Notes**: Introduced in 2023, these bring MG level detail to the chibi style. Very nice models because they are all new, but very complex builds.
