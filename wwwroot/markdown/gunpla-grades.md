## Gunpla Grades Overview

Gunpla (Gundam Plastic Models) come in various scales and levels of complexity known as **Grades**. Here is a quick guide to help you choose your next kit.

### HG (High Grade) - 1/144

*   **Scale**: 1/144 (approx 13cm / 5 inches tall)
*   **Complexity**: Beginner to Intermediate
*   **Detail**: Good
*   **Notes**: High Grade was introduced in 1990 and at the time was the highest and most detailed grade. Now it is one of the simplest grades, with a huge range of models.
* **HG**: High Grade - The original High Grade line from 1990, no longer in production. Intoduced the snap-together construction and different colored parts which are now standard for all grades.
* **HGUC**: High Grade Universal Century - The widest line of HG kits with more than 250 and counting. Originally only UC timeline Mobile Suits, but expanded to include all timelines, though lately each series has been getting its own line of HG kits.
* **HGSEED**: High Grade Gundam SEED - Started in 2002, featuring Mobile Suits from the Cosmic Era timeline. Later there were **HGSEED-R** SEED Remaster versions (slightly recolored kits with sticker type decals). This was later replaced by the **HGCE** High Grade Cosmic Era line in 2014.
* **HG00**: High Grade Gundam 00 - Started in 2007, Mobile Suits from the Anno Domini timeline.
* **HGAGE**: High Grade Gundam AGE - Released between 2011-2013, Mobile Suits from the Advanced Generation timeline.
* **HGRC**: High Grade Reconguista In G - Released between 2014-2015, Mobile Suits from the Regild Century timeline.
* **HG08**: High Grade Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team - Released between 1996-1999, Mobile Suits from the "Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team" series.
* **HGGT**: High Grade Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt - Released between 2013-2017, Mobile Suits from the "Mobile Suit Gundam: Thunderbolt" series.
* **HGGTO**: High Grade Mobile Suit Gundam The Origin - Released starting in 2015, Mobile Suits from the "Mobile Suit Gundam: Origin" series.
* **HGIBO**: High Grade Iron Blooded Orphans - Released between 2015-2022, Mobile Suits from the "Iron Blooded Orphans" series and the Post Disaster timeline. First HG line to feature sub-frames. Allows the swapping of weapons and armor between kits and the Iron Blooded Arms sub-line.
* **HGWFM**: High Grade Witch From Mercury - Released starting in 2022, Mobile Suits from the "The Witch From Mercury" series and the Ad Stella timeline. Features a very modern design and lots of articulation.
* **HGGQ**: High Grade GQuuuuuuX - Released starting in 2025, Mobile Suits from the GQuuuuuuX series (Alternative UC timeline).

### MG (Master Grade) - 1/100
*   **Scale**: 1/100 (approx 18cm / 7 inches tall)
*   **Complexity**: Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detail**: High
*   **Notes**: Introduced in 1995 this grade features larger models with more detail and greater articulation. This has become one of the most popular grades for building and collecting. Beginning in 2020 there is a sub-line of redesigned MG kits called **MGEX**.

### PG (Perfect Grade) - 1/60
*   **Scale**: 1/60 (approx 30cm / 12 inches tall)
*   **Complexity**: Expert
*   **Detail**: Ultimate
*   **Notes**: Introduced in 1998, Perfect Grades are even larger than MG models and feature even more detail. Featuring LED lighting, metal parts, and fully articulated fingers. Very expensive and time-consuming. There is also a PG kit from the series 'Evangelion' and a PG kit of the 'Millenium Falcon'. Beginning in 2020 there is a sub-line of even more detailed kits called **PGU** - Perfect Grade Unleashed.

### RG (Real Grade) - 1/144
*   **Scale**: 1/144
*   **Complexity**: Advanced
*   **Detail**: Extreme
*   **Notes**: Introduced in 2010, Real Grade kits are a realistic styling that combines the compact size of HG with the detail and internal frame of MG. Known for their "Advanced MS Joint" system and high color separation. There are also six RG kits from the series 'Evangelion' and one from the series 'The King of Braves GaoGaiGar'.

### EG (Entry Grade) - 1/144
*   **Scale**: 1/144
*   **Complexity**: Beginner
*   **Detail**: Good
*   **Notes**: These are inexpensive and simpler kits in the same 1/144 scale as HG. Unfortunately by the time they are imported there isn't much price difference, so they don't have much purpose in the Western market. They have snap-off parts which don't require clippers, and still offer good articulation.

### SD (Super Deformed)
*   **Scale**: Non-scale (Chibi style)
*   **Complexity**: Beginner
*   **Detail**: Low
*   **Notes**: Cute, big-headed proportions. I like making the SD model as a palette cleanser after completing a Mobile Suit at a larger grade.
*   **SDBB**: Super Deformed BB Senshi - The original SD line, released between 1987-2018 with 412 kits in the line! The first kits in the line actually shot BBs which gave them their name.
*   **SDBBW**: Super Deformed Brave Battle Warriors - Released between 2010-2011 this line features characters from the series 'BB Senshi Sangokuden: Brave Battle Warriors'.
*   **SDEX**: Super Deformed EX Standard - Released starting in 2015 this line of SD kits features crossover with the 1/144 scale kits.
*   **SDCS**: Super Deformed Cross Silhouette - Released starting in 2018 this line features an internal frame and customizable proportions.

### MGSD (Master Grade Super Deformed)
*   **Scale**: Non-scale (Chibi style)
*   **Complexity**: Intermediate - Advanced
*   **Detail**: High
*   **Notes**: Introduced in 2023, these bring Master Grade detail to the Super Deformed chibi style. Very nice models because they are all new, but very complex builds.
